### Development model

Simple. Opiniated. Adapted to the platform.

Data based. Hosted on decentralized file storage. Accessible via ETH.

Simple EDN / hiccup based syntax.
Some simple convention (entry point).
Simple syntax for simple use cases. More complex available.

Do we want to allow direct RN model?

ClojureScript / EDN first, allow JS to.
Logic will be distributed as JS.

Allow to hook in our screens (navigate to).

Explicitely allow to access some internal subscribe / dispatch.

Growable. Composable. Reusable.

### Development process

Have some simple block based UI to create basic logic
  
UI itself can be constructed by drag and drop and sticking componenets together directly
