## Add a slide on ideas
## Remove side by side code comparison

# 14

## Transparency
We are all about open blockchain interactions. Rely on standard.
Security is one of our pillar so we require transparency. We don't believe in security by obscurity.
100% of our codebase is opensource. Accessible for everyone to see, participate.
##Contribution
That's the main idea behind OpenBounty. Anyone can join and contribute to the product, and make some money.
Actually we even use those contributions to hire new people.
Oh BTW even openbounty is opensource!
One fancy DApp you can use and see how it works.
##Audit
Because all source code is available you can check what and how things are done.
BTW we are planning a security audit that will be publicly available.
##Tweak
You can even tweak the app yourself, build it and use it as is on your phone!

# 15

2 main projects. More are coming!

status-react
UI part of this app. This is whera chat, wallet and DApp browsing is implemented.
One codebase for iOS and android.
Using modern stack (ClojureScript, react-native).
Providing best user experience we can.
Currently going through massive simplification and performance oriented work.

status-go
Our layer to the ethereum world, built on top of ethereum libraries
ethereum is desktop technology, so all optimization work happen here
Also heavily invested in optimization of ethereum itself and contributing to new technologies (LES2, new whisper)

Others: status-desktop, status-electron, hardwallet 

# 16

Even part of our process is opensource
You can see our proposition as they arrive, vote on them, comment on them 
Look at ideas repo

# 17

Not a typical app
Not a typical client server app
Part of a mesh network
Part of the ethereum network
Status is a complete light node
not mining obviously
Relay whisper messages
Opens door to a lot of inovation

Also remember status-desktop has same stack
Why not iOT stuff?

# 18

Open inovation internally
You have an idea? Make a proposition, convince people, work on it
Example of status-desktop POC
Alternative to our current QT effort
A new effort from scratch using electron JS tech stack
Reuse our logic
Already functional and usable, even if still basic

# 19

Mesh newtwork
Issues, not enough nodes
Could be controlled by big miners?
A need for much more small nodes

# 20

Mesh with status nodes included
phone
desktop
long running nodes on top of raspberry

How to incentivize people having long running nodes?
Incentivized layers
* swarm for files
* streaming
* relayer
Part of the answer?
